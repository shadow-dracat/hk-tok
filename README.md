# Hollow Knight toki pona translation

I got an idea to translate Hollow Knight into toki pona, because:
1) I didn't find any with a quick search;
2) I love Hollow Knight;
3) I like toki pona.

I also wanted to make the process public and potentially allow contributions, hence this Github page.

There is also a forum discussion for this project: https://kulupu.pona.la/d/68-pipi-utala-pi-insa-ala--hollow-knight-toki-pona-translation

Original text belongs to Team Cherry, I have no rights over that.
When it comes to the toki pona translation, feel free to add it to your game, play, stream, whatever. Credit is appreciated, but not necessary.

Current progress: 3/36 files.
